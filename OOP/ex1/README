=============================
I implemented the class acording to their function ':
 the book class represent areal book we can take from any library,
 the patron represent any patron from any l
ibrary so each class stand alone and can work for diffrent classes



=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
in the library class i used java arrays to store all the diffrent books and patrons 
i also used the index of the arry as id to the books .
when i took a book i changed his id to the partron id so i can know if the book is taken
